# Task-1
C language syntax and logic refresher

IMPORTANT Some variable declarations and function names are in my native language (Slovene). Reason being is, I did these assignments in the scope of my University. 
Hopefully the code will make sense, as I briefly explain the purpose of each task below.

In this task I revisited some C syntax basics and concepts. It was an overall logic refresher. Here are few of many examples I did.

Exercises below are in the same ascending order as in main.c

1.  Exercise: Sum of digits of University of Maribor identification numbers
2.  Exercise: Saving numbers into an array
3.  Exercise: Second largest number
4.  Exercise: Checking the number if it has 3 dividers
5.  Exercise: Offseting array value by one element to the right
6.  Exercise: Clock conversion
7.  Exercise: Print number as binary
8.  Exercise: Using bitwiser operators to determine if the number is odd or even
9.  Exercise: Saving 32-bit number into 4-bytes
10. Exercise: Couting the number of bits that are set to 1 in a 16-bit random number
11. Exercise: Function recieves a 16-bit number and returns "true" if the number is binary palindrome
